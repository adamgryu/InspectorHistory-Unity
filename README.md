# Inspector History for Unity

An editor window that tracks your recent inspector history and makes it easily available.

### Features
- Easily return to an object after accidentally clicking away.
- Drag and drop objects from the history window into the scene or into an inspector field.
- Star objects that you want to return to frequently.
- Double-click an object to open it directly from the history window.
- Right-click to ping objects from the history.
- Drag scene objects into a scene object in the history window.

## Installation
1. Open the Package Manager, press the `+` button, and select "Add package from git URL."
2. Copy in this URL: `https://github.com/adamgryu/InspectorHistory-Unity.git`

## How To Use
Open the history window via `Window > General > History`. I like to snap the window below the hierarchy.

## Credits
While this project was written entirely from scratch, it is very similar to [Unity History Window by Ariel Coppes](https://github.com/acoppes/unity-history-window) which I referenced while working on this. My version of this concept is tailored to my UI/UX preferences, but consider using his version if it suits you better!
